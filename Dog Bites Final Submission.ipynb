    "> Why? There are many reasons but the biggest hurdles include a lack of a centralized reporting system for dog\n",
    "> bites. Dog bite incidents are reported to one of many agencies which then do not share that information with the\n",
    "> others. For example, the emergency room, the police, the veterinarian are just a few. This makes meaningful\n",
